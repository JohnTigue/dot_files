Brian Froud's Puck

This is Tigue's minimalist devel(opment) Docker image. Its companion
is [[../falstaff/Readme.org][falstaff]], which does not aim to be small and agile, rather falstaff adds
any old tool via a kitchen sink mentality.

If you had the knack, Puck might do minor housework for you, quick
fine needlework or butter-churning, which could be undone in a moment
by his knavish tricks if you displeased him

#+begin_quote
Inadvertently including files that are not necessary for building an
image results in a larger build context and larger image size. This
can increase the time to build the image, time to pull and push it,
and the container runtime size.

Puck's parent image is Aline, because accoring to [[https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#dockerfile-instructions][doc.docker.com]]:
#+begin_quote
Whenever possible, use current official images as the basis for your
images. We recommend the Alpine image as it is tightly controlled and
small in size (currently under 5 MB), while still being a full Linux
distribution.
