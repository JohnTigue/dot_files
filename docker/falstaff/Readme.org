This is Tigue's big, generic, kitchen-sink devel(opment) Docker image. Its
companion is [[../puck/Readme.org][Puck]], which is a much more minimal Docker image
containing only for quick, small, transient tasks.
 
Note this a development Docker image. Production would not require,
say, a text editor such as emacs.

| Tool   | Purpose                        |
|--------+--------------------------------|
| emacs  | Edit all the things            |
| tree   | Peek at file tree              |
|        |                                |


** Open questions
- python
  -  Just part of ubuntu:18.04?
